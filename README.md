normal website +manifest.json+serviceworker

# web app manifest:
The web app manifest is a simple JSON file that informs the browser about your web app. 
It tells how it should behave when installed on the user's mobile device or desktop. 
And to show the Add to Home Screen prompt, the web app manifest is required.
# serviceworker
pwa worker only on https thhus serviceworker can handle it. it can network requests etc....
A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background in a separate thread. 
That means it runs in a different place and is completely separate from your web page. That's the reason why it can't manipulate your DOM element.
